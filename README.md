# Advanced-Port-Scanning-using-Nmap

This project focuses on advanced port scanning using the Nmap tool. Port scanning involves examining a network to identify active ports, which can be open or unfiltered. It also helps determine the presence of firewalls and provides information about the application using a specific port, including its version, services, and protocol.

Nmap Script Engine (NSE) is a digital library of Nmap scripts and is one of Nmap’s most powerful features and it extends the capabilities of Nmap. NSE uses simple scripts written in Lua programming language. The scripts created performs a wide variety of automated network tasks and reports them. The main results that are achieved through open ports using Nmap script engine are network & service discovery, advanced version detection, vulnerability detection, detection of malware, backdoor detection and exploitation. All of these scripts are stored in the “script category”.
